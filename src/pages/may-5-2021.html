          Inspiration from the Rainforest
        </h1>

        <p class="text elem">
          It's easy to sit in a comfortable armchair dreaming of saving the
          world or at least having some impact on the environment. It's quite
          another thing to walk through ancient forests and along the Amazon
          rainforest basin, experiencing natural forces at work.
        </p>
        <p class="text elem">
          Traversing an area that sustains our life on earth is a humbling
          experience not to mention the incredible spirituality and inspiration
          seeping into one's soul. As a lifelong environmental artist, I have
          done just that-worked in the studio trying to impact my audiences'
          awareness of the natural world without fully experiencing the real
          thing.
        </p>
        <p class="text elem">
          Of course, I was well aware of the importance of the rainforest and
          its biodiversity, but It was not until I traveled to the rainforest,
          that I truly felt the deeper connection to the environment. An
          eyewitness account and meeting the indigenous peoples was beyond
          anything I could have imagined. The deep connection and understanding
          of the ecosystem by these people are things that must be preserved.
          They are truly the keepers of the ancient knowledge of plants, animals
          and medicinal practices that can possibly have a huge impact on
          western attitudes, lifestyles, and health.
        </p>
        <p class="text elem">
          I don't pretend to have gained a working knowledge of the rainforest
          and its treasures but did witness enough to know that there is a great
          deal to be gained by its preservation and support of the indigenous
          tribes living within its borders.
        </p>
        <p class="text elem">
          Upon return, my own work as an artist, drew upon the inspiration and
          spirituality felt in the rainforest. The colors, shapes, nuances of
          meaning have all manifested themselves in work which I hope will alert
          others to the importance of environmental awareness and stewardship.
        </p>

        <p class="elem text">
          I am looking forward to a future trip to the Amazon, learning more
          about the treasures within and the people who sustain and are
          sustained by the rainforest, and creating more work addressing the
          need to preserve and learn from the environment.
